## Unzipper - A Rust Zip file extractor.

This library provides functionality to unzip files that are compressed in the ZIP (PKZip) format, including reading the directory, extracting files, and handling errors related to zip operations.

It uses the miniz_oxide crate to access and decompress the files that are part of the zip file.

The unzipper is open-source and can be freely used and modified under the terms of the MIT license.
